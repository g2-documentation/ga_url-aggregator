# ga_url-aggregator

Document360 serves two different URLs from the same article (`/g2/docs/{article-title}` or /`docs/{article-title}`), which makes analyzing the most trafficked articles per month more difficult.

This script intakes a CSV file from Google Analytics and outputs a CSV of aggregated traffic from the URL slugs.
